# How to build

To build the game on Windows you should just execute the **BuildGame.bat** as an administrator. This file will install Unity Hub and the needed Unity version to build the game in the standard directories. The built game will appear next to the directory of the repository. If Unity Hub and the needed Unity version is already installed at those paths it will use those executables. 

**Quick Comment:** If Unity is already installed at another location then specify that path in the batch script or else the scipt will install Unity again. To build the game on another platform you should be able to specify that version in the batch script, but i cannot guarantee it to work as i have not tested it myself.
